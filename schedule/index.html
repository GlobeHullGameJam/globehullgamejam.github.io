<p>When everything is happening over the weekend.</p>

<h2 id="friday-day-1-arrival">Friday Day 1 – Arrival</h2>

<p>You should register as a Jammer on the Global Game Jam local site here:
<a href="https://globalgamejam.org/2018/jam-sites/university-hull">https://globalgamejam.org/2018/jam-sites/university-hull</a>
This is not the same as the EventBrite registration which was just a reliable way for me to extract money out of you.
Rather it is registration with the Game Jam proper and also allows you to make a team and publicise your game. You want to attach yourselves to our local site.</p>

<h2 id="17-00-18-00-announcements-keynote">17.00-18.00: Announcements &amp; Keynote</h2>

<p>This will occur in Robert Blackburn Lecture Theatre A.</p>

<p>This is when the theme will be released. It is a secret, and because of the different time zones all over the world it is important that you don’t reveal the theme on social media or elsewhere until Hawaii reveals the theme at around 05.00 on Saturday morning our time.</p>

<h2 id="18-00-thinking-of-ideas-and-or-team-forming">18.00: Thinking of ideas and/or team forming.</h2>

<p>Though it is likely that you all registered with pre-formed groups in mind, there is an opportunity for groups to form at this point (this is more in keeping with the GGJ ethos, but we certainly don’t enforce it).
You are probably by this point already brimming with half formed ideas. Now is the time to start fleshing them out. Remember that there isn’t a rush to start coding. It may be worth spending the time before the pizza arrives just thinking about things.</p>

<h2 id="19-30-pizza-will-arrive">~19.30 Pizza will arrive</h2>

<p>Food aplenty will arrive to fill your bellies and fuel your minds.
After this, the hard graft will begin.</p>

<p>As we trialled with the last Three Thing Games we are having a deliberately scheduled break overnight for sleeping and showering etc. The games industry has made progress since its infancy with regards to work/life balance and healthy working practices and we are changing too.
At around 21.00 we will close the lab, get some sleep, freshening up, ready to return at 10.00 the next morning to sprint to the finish.</p>

<h2 id="saturday-day-2-work">Saturday Day 2 – Work</h2>

<h2 id="10-00-you-are-back-you-are-clean-you-have-slept-you-are-rearing-to-go">10.00: You are back! You are clean! You have slept! You are rearing to go!</h2>

<p>Make sure that you feed yourselves as well. At various points snacks will appear and be available but you should also take care of yourselves. This applies to breakfast and lunch.</p>

<h2 id="11-00-deadline-to-create-user-profile-and-game-page">11.00 Deadline to create user profile and game page</h2>

<h2 id="18-00-19-30-playtesting-each-other-s-games">18.00-19.30: Playtesting each other&rsquo;s games</h2>

<p>Don’t just bury your heads in your own work; mingle! Have a look at what other teams are doing, maybe have a go on the works in progress and provide feedback.</p>

<h2 id="15-00-16-30-deadline-for-handing-in-the-games-is-15-00">15.00-16.30: Deadline for handing in the games is 15.00</h2>

<h2 id="16-30-19-00-presentations-each-team-has-10-minutes-to-do-a-short-presentation">16.30-19.00: Presentations – Each team has 10 minutes to do a short presentation</h2>
